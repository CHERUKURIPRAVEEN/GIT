## Git Commands

```
# git config
With Git, there are many configurations and settings possible. git config is how to assign these settings. Two important settings are user user.name and user.email. These values set what email address and name commits will be from on a local computer. With git config, a --global flag is used to write the settings to all repositories on a computer. Without a --global flag settings will only apply to the current repository that you are currently in.
$ git config --global user.name "Username"
$ git config --global user.email "my@emailaddress.com"
```
```
# git status
The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git
$ git status
```
```
# git init
The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository
$ git init
```
```
# git add
Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.
$ git add <file or directory name>
$ git add .
$ git add index.html
```
```
# git commit
Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.
$ git commit -m "Commit message"
```
```
# git branch
To determine what branch the local repository is on, add a new branch, or delete a branch.
# Create a new branch
$ git branch <branch_name>
# List all remote or local branches
$ git branch -a
# Delete a branch
$ git branch -d <branch_name>
```
```
# git checkout
To start working in a different branch, use git checkout to switch branches.
# Checkout an existing branch
$ git checkout <branch_name>
# Checkout and create a new branch with that name
$ git checkout -b <new_branch>
```
```
# git merge
Integrate branches together. git merge combines the changes from one branch to another branch. For example, merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch.
# Merge changes into current branch
$ git merge <branch_name>
```
```
# git remote
To connect a local repository with a remote repository. A remote repository can have a name set to avoid having to remember the URL of the repository.
# Add remote repository
$ git remote add <remote_URL>
# List named remote repositories
$ git remote -v
```
```
# git clone
To create a local working copy of an existing remote repository, use git clone to copy and download the repository to a computer. Cloning is the equivalent of git init when working with a remote repository. Git will create a directory locally with all files and repository history.
$ git clone <remote_URL>
```
```
# git pull
To get the latest version of a repository run git pull. This pulls the changes from the remote repository to the local computer.
$ git pull <branch_name> <remote_URL/remote_name>
```
```
# git push
Sends local commits to the remote repository. git push requires two parameters: the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.
$ git push <remote_URL/remote_name> <branch>
# Push all local branches to remote repository
$ git push â€”all
```
```
# git tag
$ git tag -a <tag name> -m <tag messgae> <commit id/ HEAD>
```
```
# git log
$ git log 
$ git log --oneline
$ git log --follow <file>
```
```
# git show
$ git show <commit id>
```
```
# git diff
$ git diff <source branch> <destination branch>
```
```
# git reset
$ git reset <file name>
$ git reset <commit id>
$ 
```
